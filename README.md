# Santeri's recipes

Repetition and iteration of a thing is fun.
I often prefer to measure in grams, but volumetric measurements are used for conviniency.
Seasoning is not exact and often not defined accurately. I prefer to taste the food while cooking.

Attribution is given sometimes.

Thanks mom!
